# BUSINESS SCENARIO

In 2025, the healthcare industry faces an unprecedented demand for nurses, exacerbated by persistent staffing shortages. 
To proactively address this challenge and improve nurse retention, a major healthcare system implemented an Employee Well-being 
Program three years ago. This voluntary program aims to reduce job-related stress, a significant contributor to high nurse turnover, 
by offering monthly activities designed to enhance employee morale and well-being. The hospital's executive council is now evaluating 
the program's efficacy to inform future funding and expansion decisions, particularly considering the substantial costs associated with 
nurse attrition.
