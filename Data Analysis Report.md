# BUSINESS SCENARIO

In 2025, the healthcare industry faces an unprecedented demand for nurses, exacerbated by persistent staffing shortages. 
To proactively address this challenge and improve nurse retention, a major healthcare system implemented an Employee Well-being 
Program three years ago. This voluntary program aims to reduce job-related stress, a significant contributor to high nurse turnover, 
by offering monthly activities designed to enhance employee morale and well-being. The hospital's executive council is now evaluating 
the program's efficacy to inform future funding and expansion decisions, particularly considering the substantial costs associated with 
nurse attrition.

# BUSINESS QUESTION
Escalating nurse burnout, coupled with rising resignation rates and persistent staffing shortages, is significantly impacting the quality and sustainability of healthcare delivery. Given the hospital's goal of mitigating nurse attrition through the Employee Well-being Program, does a significant linear relationship exist between monthly Program Participation and Nurse Attrition Rates over the past three years, and can this relationship inform future retention strategies?

# NULL HYPOTHESIS
This research investigates the relationship between Nurse Participation Rate in the Employee Well-being Program and Nurse Attrition Rates. Specifically, over a period of three years, it seeks to determine if there is a measurable linear association between the monthly program participation rate of nurses and the corresponding monthly nurse attrition rate.
The null hypothesis (H0) for this linear regression analysis states that there is no statistically significant linear relationship between the monthly program participation rate of nurses and the
