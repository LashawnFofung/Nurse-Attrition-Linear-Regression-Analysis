<h3>BUSINESS SCENARIO</h3>

In 2025, the healthcare industry faces an unprecedented demand for nurses, exacerbated by persistent staffing shortages. 
To proactively address this challenge and improve nurse retention, a major healthcare system implemented an Employee Well-being 
Program three years ago. This voluntary program aims to reduce job-related stress, a significant contributor to high nurse turnover, 
by offering monthly activities designed to enhance employee morale and well-being. The hospital's executive council is now evaluating 
the program's efficacy to inform future funding and expansion decisions, particularly considering the substantial costs associated with 
nurse attrition.

<h3>BUSINESS QUESTION</h3>
Escalating nurse burnout, coupled with rising resignation rates and persistent staffing shortages, is significantly impacting the quality and sustainability of healthcare delivery. Given the hospital's goal of mitigating nurse attrition through the Employee Well-being Program, does a significant linear relationship exist between monthly Program Participation and Nurse Attrition Rates over the past three years, and can this relationship inform future retention strategies?

<h3>NULL HYPOTHESIS</h3>
This research investigates the relationship between Nurse Participation Rate in the Employee Well-being Program and Nurse Attrition Rates. Specifically, over a period of three years, it seeks to determine if there is a measurable linear association between the monthly program participation rate of nurses and the corresponding monthly nurse attrition rate.
The null hypothesis (H0) for this linear regression analysis states that there is no statistically significant linear relationship between the monthly program participation rate of nurses and the monthly nurse attrition rate. In practical terms, this hypothesis assumes that changes in the level of program participation are not systematically related to changes in nurse attrition rates.

<h3>ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE JUSTIFICATION</h3>
Given the hospital's objective to mitigate nurse attrition through the Employee Well-being Program, and the need to determine if a significant linear relationship exists between monthly program participation and nurse attrition rates over the past three years, linear regression was selected as the appropriate analytical technique. This choice is supported by several key factors:
  
  - Quantifying the Relationship: Linear regression allows for the precise quantification of the relationship between program       participation rates (independent variable) and nurse attrition rates (dependent variable). It determines the strength and direction of this relationship, providing insights into how changes in participation rates influence attrition. This directly addresses the core question of whether a statistically significant relationship exists.
  - Predictive Modeling: Should a statistically significant relationship be established, linear regression generates a predictive linear equation. This equation can then be utilized to forecast future nurse attrition rates based on varying program participation rates. This capability is essential for strategic planning and resource allocation, enabling the hospital to make informed decisions regarding program adjustments and retention strategies.
  - Statistical Significance Testing: Linear regression provides a framework for testing the null hypothesis, which states that no statistically significant linear relationship exists between monthly program participation rates and nurse attrition rates. By calculating the p-value, we can determine the likelihood that any observed relationship is a genuine effect of the program rather than a result of random variation. This is crucial for evaluating the program's efficacy, as outlined in the business scenario.

In summary, linear regression is a critical analytical tool for this context. It allows for the examination and quantification of the relationship between program participation and nurse attrition, facilitating an assessment of the program's effectiveness. Moreover, the predictive capabilities of linear regression enable the hospital to make data-driven decisions regarding resource allocation and program enhancements. Finally, the statistical significance testing provides a rigorous evaluation of the program's impact, ensuring that any conclusions drawn are statistically sound.
