# Nurse Attrition Linear Regression - Data Analysis of WGU Provided Dataset

This repository showcases an analysis performed on a dataset provided by Western Governors University for academic purposes. 

# Project Description
Faced with the critical issue of nurse retention amid increasing demand and persistent staffing shortages in 2025, a major healthcare system implemented an Employee Well-being Program three years ago to reduce job-related stress and improve nurse retention. The project aimed to analyze the program's effectiveness in achieving this goal by analyzing the relationship between monthly participation rates and nurse attrition rates. Linear regression is employed to determine the statistical significance and predictive power of this relationship, with the findings intended to guide the hospital executive council's decisions regarding program funding and expansion.
